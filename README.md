# War-card-game
This project is a web-based implementation of the popular card game War, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and the goal is to collect all the cards by winning "battles" against the computer. The project uses an API to retrieve a shuffled deck of cards.
